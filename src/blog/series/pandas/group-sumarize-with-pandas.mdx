# Grouping and Summarizing Data with Pandas (Without Pain) 📊

In this post, we’ll explore how to **group and summarize your data** with Pandas using methods like:

- `groupby()`
- `agg()`
- `pivot_table()`

These tools help you answer real questions like:

- What's the average price per category?
- Which brand has the most products?
- How many products are in stock per category?

---

## 🧱 Let's load the data

We’ll use the same dataset (`prices_sample.csv`):

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("prices_sample.csv")
```

---

## 🔢 Using `groupby()` + aggregation

Let’s start simple: what’s the **average price per category**?

```python
avg_price = df.groupby("category")["price"].mean()
print(avg_price)
```

You can also get multiple aggregations:

```python
summary = df.groupby("category")["price"].agg(["mean", "min", "max", "count"])
print(summary)
```

---

## 🧠 Custom aggregations with `agg()`

You can even pass custom functions or lambdas:

```python
df.groupby("brand")["price"].agg(
    average="mean",
    highest="max",
    products="count"
)
```

You can rename the output columns with `named aggregation` like above (`average=...`).

---

## 📊 Counting products per category

This is a very common task:

```python
product_counts = df["category"].value_counts()
print(product_counts)
```

Or using groupby:

```python
df.groupby("category")["product_id"].count()
```

---

## 🔄 Using `pivot_table()`

Pivot tables give you more flexibility for reshaping data. Let’s say we want the **average price per category and availability**:

```python
pivot = pd.pivot_table(df, values="price", index="category", columns="in_stock", aggfunc="mean")
print(pivot)
```

This shows how price changes depending on whether items are in stock or not.

---

## 🔁 Reshaping with `.unstack()` and `.melt()`

You can convert groupby results into wide format with `.unstack()`:

```python
group = df.groupby(["category", "in_stock"])["price"].mean()
print(group.unstack())
```

Or go from wide → long format using `.melt()`:

```python
melted = df.melt(id_vars=["category"], value_vars=["price"])
print(melted.head())
```

---

## 🧠 When to use each?

| Task                     | Use                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Simple summaries         | `groupby()`           |
| Complex reshaping        | `pivot_table()`       |
| Multi-level aggregations | `agg()`               |
| Format manipulation      | `melt()`, `unstack()` |

---

## ✅ Summary

Grouping and aggregating are essential tools in your data toolkit.

Remember:

- `groupby()` for grouping rows
- `agg()` for multiple summaries
- `pivot_table()` for reshaping with aggregations
- `value_counts()` for quick category counts

## 📌 What’s next?

In **Part 6**, we’ll work with **dates and time** in Pandas: parsing, grouping by month/week, and time series tricks ⏳.

Perfect if you want to build charts over time or analyze trends.

See you there!
