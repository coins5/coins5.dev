# 📊 Part 6: Grouping and Aggregating Data in Pandas

One of the most powerful features of Pandas is its ability to group and aggregate data. In this post, we'll learn how to use `.groupby()` to gain insights from a dataset containing sales information for various products over a 30-day period.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

We’ll be using the `prices_with_sales.csv` file, which contains the following columns:

- `product_id`
- `product_name`
- `brand`
- `price`
- `date`
- `quantity_sold`

Let’s load the data:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("prices_with_sales.csv")
df.head()
```

### Example output

|     | product_id | product_name | brand   | price | date       | quantity_sold |
| --- | ---------- | ------------ | ------- | ----- | ---------- | ------------- |
| 0   | 1          | Milk         | Brand A | 3.5   | 2025-07-01 | 5             |
| 1   | 1          | Milk         | Brand A | 3.5   | 2025-07-02 | 7             |
| 2   | 1          | Milk         | Brand A | 3.5   | 2025-07-03 | 6             |

## 🧮 Total Quantity Sold by Product

To find out which products sold the most units overall:

```python
df.groupby("product_name")["quantity_sold"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

This shows the total quantity sold for each product.

---

## 💰 Calculating Revenue

Let’s create a `revenue` column and analyze which products generated the most money:

```python
df["revenue"] = df["price"] * df["quantity_sold"]
```

Now group by product:

```python
df.groupby("product_name")["revenue"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False)
```

You can also break it down further by brand:

```python
df.groupby(["brand", "product_name"])["revenue"].sum()
```

---

## 📅 Aggregation by Date

To analyze daily performance:

```python
daily = df.groupby("date")[["quantity_sold", "revenue"]].sum()
```

If you'd like to visualize trends:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

daily.plot(figsize=(12, 6), title="Daily Sales and Revenue Over Time")
plt.show()

```

---

## 📊 Aggregating Multiple Stats

You can calculate multiple metrics in one go using `.agg()`:

```python
df.groupby("brand").agg({
    "price": "mean",
    "quantity_sold": "sum",
    "revenue": ["sum", "mean"]
})
```

This returns a summary for each brand, including average price, total units sold, and revenue metrics.

---

## 🔁 Resetting the Index (Optional)

Grouped results have the group key as the index. To reset it:

```python
summary = df.groupby("product_name")["quantity_sold"].sum().reset_index()
```

Now `product_name` becomes a regular column again.

---

## ✅ Wrap-up

In this part, we learned how to:

- Use `groupby()` to group data by one or more columns

- Calculate custom metrics like total revenue

- Aggregate multiple statistics at once

- Analyze trends over time
