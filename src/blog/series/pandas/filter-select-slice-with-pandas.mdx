# Filtering, Selecting and Slicing Your Data Like a Ninja 🥷

Once your data is loaded and clean, the next step is to **zoom in** on what matters — rows, columns, and specific conditions.

In this post, we’ll cover:

✅ Selecting specific columns  
✅ Filtering rows with conditions  
✅ Using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`  
✅ Combining multiple filters  
✅ Slicing data like a pro

Let’s slice and dice!

---

## 📦 Load the dataset

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("prices_sample.csv")
```

---

## 🎯 Selecting columns

Just want one column?

```python
df["price"]
```

Multiple columns?

```python
df[["product_name", "price"]]
```

---

## 🧽 Filtering rows by condition

Let’s say you want all products that cost more than 5:

```python
df[df["price"] > 5]
```

Now products that are **in stock**:

```python
df[df["in_stock"] == True]
```

Or **products not in stock** and **price below 4**:

```python
df[(df["in_stock"] == False) & (df["price"] < 4)]
```

---

## 🧠 Using `.loc[]` and `.iloc[]`

`.loc[]` is label-based.  
`.iloc[]` is index-based.

**Example with `.loc[]`:**

```python
# First row, all columns
df.loc[0]

# First 3 rows, specific columns
df.loc[0:2, ["product_name", "price"]]
```

**Example with `.iloc[]`:**

```python
# First row
df.iloc[0]

# First 5 rows and first 3 columns
df.iloc[0:5, 0:3]
```

---

## 🪓 Slicing like a pro

Let’s say you want the **top 10 most expensive products**:

```python
df.sort_values("price", ascending=False).head(10)
```

Or the **5 cheapest in stock**:

```python
df[df["in_stock"] == True].sort_values("price").head(5)
```

---

## 🧠 Pro tip: Use `.query()` for readable filters

You can also use `.query()` to write conditions in a cleaner way:

```python
df.query("in_stock == True and price < 5")
```

Much easier to read and chain when things get complex.

---

## ✅ Summary

Filtering and selecting is one of the most common things you'll do in Pandas.

- Use `[]`, `.loc[]`, `.iloc[]` to select rows and columns
- Use conditions to filter rows
- Use `.query()` for clarity in complex logic
- Combine with `.sort_values()` and `.head()` to get top/bottom lists
