# üßπ Part 7: Handling Missing Data in Pandas

Real-world data is rarely perfect. Missing values are common, and how you handle them can significantly impact your analysis. In this post, we‚Äôll learn how to **detect**, **analyze**, and **fill or remove** missing data using Pandas.

---

## üßê Detecting Missing Values

Let‚Äôs start by loading a modified version of our dataset that contains missing values:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("prices_with_sales_with_missing.csv")
```

To check for missing values in each column:

```python
df.isnull().sum()
```

To get a quick overview of how much data is missing relative to the whole dataset:

```python
df.isnull().mean()
```

---

## üîé Identifying Missing Rows

You can filter the rows that contain any missing values:

```python
df[df.isnull().any(axis=1)]
```

Or rows with missing values in a specific column, for example `price`:

```python
df[df["price"].isnull()]
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Common Fixes for Missing Data

### 1. **Filling missing values**

#### a. Fill with a default value:

```python
df["price"].fillna(0, inplace=True)
```

#### b. Fill with the mean or median:

```python
df["price"].fillna(df["price"].mean(), inplace=True)
```

#### c. Forward-fill or backward-fill:

```python
df["price"].fillna(method="ffill", inplace=True)  # uses previous value
df["price"].fillna(method="bfill", inplace=True)  # uses next value
```

### 2. **Dropping missing values**

#### a. Drop rows with _any_ missing value:

```python
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

#### b. Drop rows with missing values only in specific columns:

```python
df.dropna(subset=["quantity_sold"], inplace=True)
```

## üß™ Before and After Comparison

You can compare how many rows were removed or filled:

```python
print("Before:", len(df))
df_clean = df.dropna()
print("After:", len(df_clean))
```

---

## üßº Best Practices

- **Never remove data blindly.** Investigate why values are missing.
- If the missing values are:
  - **Rare**, you can drop them.
  - **Systematic** (e.g. prices missing on certain dates), you might need deeper analysis.
- Document how you handled missing data for reproducibility.

## ‚úÖ Wrap-up

In this part, we covered:

- How to **detect** missing data
- How to **fill** or **drop** missing values
- When to use each method

Handling missing data is one of the first steps toward building reliable data pipelines.
