After your first `logger.info("Hello world")`, it's time to take logging seriously.  
In this post, we'll cover how to configure **rotation**, **retention**, **compression**, and how to combine **console + file logging** effectively for real-world use cases.

---

## üöÄ Basic Loguru Setup

```python
from loguru import logger

logger.add("app.log")
logger.info("Starting the application")
```

But that doesn't scale. In production, you need to control:

- How large your logs can grow.

- How long to keep them.

- How to archive them.

- Where to send them.

## üì¶ Log Rotation

```python
logger.add("app.log", rotation="10 MB")
```

Or rotate daily:

```python
logger.add("app.log", rotation="00:00")  # Every midnight
```

## üßπ Log Retention

Automatically delete old logs:

```python
logger.add("app.log", rotation="10 MB", retention="7 days")

```

Or keep just the last 5 files:

```python

logger.add("app.log", rotation="10 MB", retention=5)
```

## üóúÔ∏è Compression

If you're storing logs, compress them to save space:

```python
logger.add("app.log", rotation="100 MB", retention="10 days", compression="zip")

```

Also supports `"gz"`, `"tar"`, etc.

## üéØ Logging Levels per Output

Send different log levels to different outputs:

```python
logger.add(sys.stderr, level="INFO")        # Only INFO+ to console
logger.add("debug.log", level="DEBUG")      # Full details to file
```

## üß™ Full Setup Example

```python
from loguru import logger
import sys

logger.remove()  # Clear default handlers

logger.add(
    "app.log",
    rotation="10 MB",
    retention="10 days",
    compression="zip",
    level="DEBUG"
)

logger.add(sys.stderr, level="INFO")
```

## üß† Pro Tip: Environment-Based Config

```python
import os

level = "DEBUG" if os.getenv("ENV") == "dev" else "INFO"

logger.add("app.log", level=level, rotation="5 MB", retention="7 days")

```

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Loguru makes it easy to set up a production-grade logging system in just a few lines.
You get power and simplicity, without the headache of configuring the standard logging module.
