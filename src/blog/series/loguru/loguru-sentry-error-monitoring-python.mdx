Loguru gives you elegant logs.  
Sentry gives you **stack traces, alerts, context and error history**.

Together, they make production debugging a breeze.  
In this post, you'll learn how to connect Loguru with Sentry for full visibility over your app's issues.

## ⚡ Why Use Sentry?

Sentry tracks:

- Exceptions and stack traces
- Breadcrumbs (context before crash)
- Tags and user info
- Affected releases
- Alerts in Slack, Email, etc.

## 🔌 Install Sentry SDK

```bash
pip install sentry-sdk
```

Then initialize it in your app:

```python
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(
    dsn="https://<your-key>@o0.ingest.sentry.io/<project-id>",
    traces_sample_rate=1.0,  # Enable performance monitoring (optional)
)

```

## 🔗 Integrate with Loguru

The key is to forward exceptions to Sentry.

### Option 1: Use Loguru's Exception Hook

```python
from loguru import logger
import sentry_sdk

def sentry_excepthook(exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
    logger.error("Exception caught", exc_info=(exc_type, exc_value, traceback))
    sentry_sdk.capture_exception(exc_value)

logger.remove()
logger.add(sys.stderr, backtrace=True, diagnose=True)

logger.configure(
    handlers=[
        {"sink": sys.stderr, "level": "INFO"},
    ],
    exception_hook=sentry_excepthook
)

```

Now any uncaught exception is logged and sent to Sentry.

### 🚀 Option 2: Log Specific Errors to Sentry

You can manually send to Sentry in critical areas:

```python
try:
    1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    logger.exception("Division error occurred")
    sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)

```

## 🧠 Add Context with Tags

You can add user IDs, environments, etc.:

```python
with sentry_sdk.push_scope() as scope:
    scope.set_tag("user_id", 42)
    scope.set_extra("context", {"foo": "bar"})
    sentry_sdk.capture_exception(e)

```

This helps you debug issues faster in Sentry UI.

## 🧪 FastAPI + Loguru + Sentry

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from loguru import logger
import sentry_sdk

sentry_sdk.init(dsn="https://...")

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
def crash():
    raise RuntimeError("Something exploded!")

```

With the Loguru hook, this crash is logged and visible in your Sentry dashboard with full context.

## ✅ Summary

- Initialize Sentry at startup
- Hook exceptions with Loguru
- Add context when needed
- Get visibility on production errors instantly
