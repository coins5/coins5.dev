In distributed systems, logs need to go to **centralized services** â€” like a log server, HTTP endpoint, or syslog daemon.

In this post, you'll learn how to stream Loguru logs across the network â€” no extra logging library needed.

## ðŸ“¤ Use a Custom Sink

Loguru lets you define any custom destination â€” called a **sink**.

That means you can send logs via:

- HTTP (to services like Logtail, Datadog, Logstash)
- TCP/UDP (to a log collector)
- WebSocket
- External tools or APIs

## ðŸš€ Example 1: Send Logs via HTTP POST

```python
import requests
from loguru import logger

def http_sink(message):
    log = message.record
    data = {
        "time": log["time"].isoformat(),
        "level": log["level"].name,
        "message": log["message"],
        "extra": log["extra"]
    }
    requests.post("https://your-log-endpoint.com/logs", json=data)

logger.remove()
logger.add(http_sink, level="INFO")
```

Now every log is sent as a JSON POST request.

## ðŸ§ª Example 2: Send Logs via UDP to Syslog

```python
import socket
from loguru import logger

udp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
target = ("your.syslog.server", 514)

def syslog_sink(message):
    udp_socket.sendto(message.encode("utf-8"), target)

logger.remove()
logger.add(syslog_sink, level="INFO")
```

Send to any syslog-compatible daemon â€” even from Docker containers.

## ðŸ”„ Async-Friendly Sinks

If you're in an async app, wrap your sinks with enqueue=True:

```python
logger.add(http_sink, enqueue=True)
```

Or use libraries like aiohttp for full async I/O if needed.

## ðŸ§  Tip: Use Retry + Backoff

Network sinks can fail. Always add retry logic or use a queue-based solution like:

- Celery workers
- Redis pub/sub
- Logstash agents with buffering

## âœ… Final Thoughts

Loguru's custom sinks make it easy to forward logs to any target â€” no need for extra dependencies or complex setups.
