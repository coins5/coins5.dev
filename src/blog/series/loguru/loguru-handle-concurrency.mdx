In async apps (FastAPI, asyncio workers, etc.), logging can get tricky.  
If your logs are too fast ‚Äî or your writes too slow ‚Äî you risk blocking the event loop or even losing log lines.

In this post, we'll set up **non-blocking, thread-safe, async-friendly** logging using Loguru.

## ‚ùó The Problem with Synchronous Logging

If you log directly to disk in a tight async loop:

```python
for i in range(10000):
    logger.info(f"Logging item {i}")
```

You're doing blocking I/O. That means:

- You can slow down your app.
- You may miss logs under high load.
- In extreme cases, your app could crash or stall.

## ‚úÖ The Loguru Solution: Use a Background Thread

Loguru supports enqueue=True, which uses a background thread with a queue:

```python
logger.add("app.log", enqueue=True)
```

That's it. Now your logs won't block your event loop.

## üî¨ How it Works

- Loguru uses a SimpleQueue internally.
- Your app pushes logs instantly.
- A background thread writes them safely.

## üß™ Example with FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from loguru import logger

app = FastAPI()

logger.remove()
logger.add("app.log", enqueue=True)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    logger.info("Root endpoint hit")
    return {"message": "hello"}

```

No blocking, no lost logs ‚Äî perfect for production.

## üì¶ With JSON and Enqueue Combined

You can still use your custom formatters:

```python
logger.add("structured.json", format=json_formatter, enqueue=True)
```

It works exactly the same ‚Äî just async-safe.

## üß† Tip: Don‚Äôt Log Too Much in Tight Loops

Even with async logging, logging inside hot loops or massive async tasks can flood your disk. Use:

- Conditional logs (if debug:)
- Sampling
- Throttling (e.g. log every 1000th event)

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

If you're using FastAPI, asyncio, or any concurrent system ‚Äî always add enqueue=True.
It's the easiest way to make your logs safe, fast, and non-blocking.
