In async apps (FastAPI, asyncio workers, etc.), logging can get tricky.  
If your logs are too fast — or your writes too slow — you risk blocking the event loop or even losing log lines.

In this post, we'll set up **non-blocking, thread-safe, async-friendly** logging using Loguru.

## ❗ The Problem with Synchronous Logging

If you log directly to disk in a tight async loop:

```python
for i in range(10000):
    logger.info(f"Logging item {i}")
```

You're doing blocking I/O. That means:

- You can slow down your app.
- You may miss logs under high load.
- In extreme cases, your app could crash or stall.

## ✅ The Loguru Solution: Use a Background Thread

Loguru supports enqueue=True, which uses a background thread with a queue:

```python
logger.add("app.log", enqueue=True)
```

That’s it. Now your logs won’t block your event loop.

## 🔬 How it Works

- Loguru uses a SimpleQueue internally.
- Your app pushes logs instantly.
- A background thread writes them safely.

## 🧪 Example with FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from loguru import logger

app = FastAPI()

logger.remove()
logger.add("app.log", enqueue=True)

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    logger.info("Root endpoint hit")
    return {"message": "hello"}

```

No blocking, no lost logs — perfect for production.

## 📦 With JSON and Enqueue Combined

You can still use your custom formatters:

```python
logger.add("structured.json", format=json_formatter, enqueue=True)
```

It works exactly the same — just async-safe.

## 🧠 Tip: Don’t Log Too Much in Tight Loops

Even with async logging, logging inside hot loops or massive async tasks can flood your disk. Use:

- Conditional logs (if debug:)
- Sampling
- Throttling (e.g. log every 1000th event)

## ✅ Conclusion

If you're using FastAPI, asyncio, or any concurrent system — always add enqueue=True.
It’s the easiest way to make your logs safe, fast, and non-blocking.
