# Module 1 · Welcome to Cards Match! 🎉

Hi there! I am thrilled to guide you through this course. By the time we are done, you will have a fully playable memory game built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite.

## What we will cover

- 👀 Explore the finished experience so you know the goal
- 🧠 Understand the game mechanics at a high level before touching code
- 🗺️ Preview the roadmap for the rest of the modules

## Quick win: run the game

Fire up your local copy and see the magic in action:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173`.

Pay attention to these moments:

- ⏱️ A timed preview flips all cards at the start of each round.
- ⚡ Matches award 100 points plus up to a 1000-point speed bonus.
- 🔄 You can switch difficulty or image source (emoji vs. Giphy) instantly.

## Roadmap at a glance

1. Set up the environment like a pro.
2. Master the core game state with the `useGame` composable.
3. Craft a dynamic UI with reusable Vue components.
4. Connect image sources and persist settings locally.
5. Wrap up with persistence, polish, and ideas for extensions.

Take a deep breath, open your editor, and let us build something fun together! 🚀
